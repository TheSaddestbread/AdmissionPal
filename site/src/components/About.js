      <strong>Why did we make this?</strong>
      Applying to universities can be stressful, there are a lot of places you can go and not a lot of answers. University websites are inconsistent, difficult to sort through, and having dozens of tabs open just to compare a few universities is less than optimal. This becomes even more difficult when you try to search for Alberta-specific course requirements.

      It has always been hard to decide on a university to apply to, even more nowadays where teenagers struggled through a pandemic and admission averages go up every year.

      When considering the future, it is easy to make things complicated. What kind of average do I need? Which Alberta courses do I need? What kind of programs am I interested in? What are my options out there? Comparing universities becomes a lot more difficult when you are considering all of these factors.

      Our site, Admission Pal demonstrates the possibilities of converting complex issues of university finding into a simple task by making it understandable and readable by humans.

      <strong>Who are we?</strong>
      We are a group of highschoolers who are passionate about programming and computer science. Within the project, we were able to find major issues that impact youth today. One of them is finding a university, which is a major issue that will impact us soon. As a result, we worked together to create a project that concerns the youth of today.

      <strong>The future of the Website:</strong>
      The website could easily be expanded with the creation of more majors and more information. The kind of information that we are missing are majors that are outside of: "Software Engineering", "Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Architecture", "Psychology", "Commerce", "Art". As it stands, the skeleton of Admission Pal provides a strong basis for the future of university navigation.
